# What do I say


Hi there! Amazing to be hear once again. It's my third time speaking at Fluttercon Berlin and I couldn't be more excited. It's become a recurring theme for me to talk a bit more about the less visual side of the Flutter apps. Two years ago I talked about offline processing and last year about background tasks. This time we'll discuss native platform integration and I hope to share some of my personal lessons learned with you.

I would like to start with a bold slogan, especially having the opportunity to talk right after the amazing keynote by Kevin. Flutter native interop is great. We will go through reasons why I think so, but let me just tell you I've been really enjoying the recent progress and can't wait to see more.

- Visible 3 years
- Quite a lot of native integration
- Loosely coupled 
- Not super structured
- Experimented with various approaches
